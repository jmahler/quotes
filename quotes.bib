self: "I have to go to work -- as a human being.  What do I have to

huddle under the blankets and stay warm?"  [Pg. 53]

"18. Nothing happens to anyone that he can't endure. ..."  [Pg. 60]

"25. So other people hurt me?  That's their problem.  THeir character

Growth Mindset.  The effort becomes a dopamine generating reward.
1:44 Performing chores that give them some sense of accomplishment while
  avoiding the important tasks.  Gets one closer to deadline which
  creates panic.  A painful state (harder than what you are in) can help
  get you out of that amotivated dopamine trough state.  Cold exposure
  is one example of a painful state.

"Formulating an opinion is not listening.  Neither is preparing
a response, or defending our position or attacking another's.  To
listen impatiently is to hear nothing at all."

"It's easy for managers to find reasons to say no."  [Pg. 193]
"Managers know that if they bet on a bad idea, it might be a
career-limiting move, but if they pass on a good idea, it's unlikely
anyone will ever find out.  And even if managers are supportive of an
idea, if they perceive leaders above them as opposed to it, they tend to
see it as a losing proposition.  All it takes is one gatekeeper to close
off a new frontier."  [Pg. 194]
